# BikeSharePrediction_MLProject
Internship project
There is a rising trend in usage of bikes, particularly sharing bikes with increasing environmental consciousness, health awareness and traffic problems associated with urbanization. Hence, bike sharing or rentals is a highly growing business with immense potential particularly due to ease in renting and handing over, automated process and lack of ownership and maintenance problems. In addition, here is a huge data driven business and research opportunity which itself is very huge in itself, may be bigger than even rental business. This is because departure, arrival, duration of travel, locations of travel etc are recorded in these systems. As such, due to these dual sides of business, predicting exact demand for bikes in necessary to reduce costs related to excess supply as well as to harness full potential of rental and data analysis business. Thus, this project aims to predict demand of users up to the time interval of hours based on previous usage and using end to end regression.
